How I deployed it:



I coded the smart contract in Remix, making sure it can issue and verify certificates.  

Then, I connected Remix to my MetaMask wallet and switched to the Sepolia testnet.  

After a bit of grinding and triple-checking, I deployed the contract—MetaMask confirmed the transaction,  

and the contract was live.  



All certificates are stored on-chain, so you can’t fake them. I also tested issuing and verifying certificates,  

and everything worked perfectly. This setup shows how decentralized certificate verification can be simple,  

secure, and tamper-proof.
